Pinocchio is a deep, deep story. It has echoes that go back three or four thousand years to the earliest stories we know, and it's so rich in information, that a child can watch it over and over and over and over. Pinocchio is born wooden, unformed and on strings, guided by forces and impulses he doesn't control. To become free, first he 'wishes upon a star' to become a 'real' boy. Then he battles his fears and desires, learns to listen to his conscience (Jiminy Cricket), tells the truth and finally sacrifices himself for others.
